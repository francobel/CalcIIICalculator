# Vector Calculus Calculator

This is a desktop application that is aimed to help anyone that's currently enrolled in a Calculus 3 course and would like to have an all in one tool handy. This project has 3 main sections.

	Vector Algebra
	Differential Operators
	Derivates


The VECTOR ALGEBRA section is compromised of 5 tools.

	1. Vector Addition
	2. Vector Subctraction
	3. Scalar Multiplication
	4. Dot Product
	5. Cross Product

These tools will generally have 1 or 2 empty fields for you fill in with vectors.
The input should be in ORDER SET NOTATION

	ex: (1,2,3) , (0,3,5)

At this point in time the tools only work with integers. Float interaction will come in the future. 


The DIFFERENTIAL OPERATORS section comes with 3 tools.

	1. Gradient
	2. Divergence
	3. Curl

GRADIENT:
For all the differential operator tools you will get an empty field in which you will input whatever corresponds to the operation you have selected.
For the gradient tool you have to enter a function into the empty field.
At the moment you have to enter your function in a very unconventional way, if I have time later I might change it. There's three unconventionalities:

	- Your variables should be lower case or they wont work.
	- You have to explicitly represnt you multiplications with an asterisk.
	- When you want to raise to a power, instead of using '^' you will use a double 
	  asterisk '**'.

What you would normally write in your math class as: 2X^2+3Y+3
                                 Should be input as: 2*x**+3*y+3

Gradient Def: When you take the gradient of a function you take the partial derivative of it with respect to x, y and z and form a vector field with the results of the partial derivation. 
A function ends up yielding a vector field.
